# This setting can be used to help debug what's going on with HTTP requests made
# by Cargo. When set to `true` then Cargo's normal debug logging will be filled
# in with HTTP information, which you can extract with
# `CARGO_LOG=cargo::ops::registry=debug` (and `trace` may print more).
#
# Be wary when posting these logs elsewhere though, it may be the case that a
# header has an authentication token in it you don't want leaked! Be sure to
# briefly review logs before posting them.
